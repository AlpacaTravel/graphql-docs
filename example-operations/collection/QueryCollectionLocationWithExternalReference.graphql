# Queries collection items based on a ID within an external platform. When
# creating locations, you can set the attributes custom://external-ref and
# custom://external-source in order to store identifiers and sources of your
# platform. This enables you to reference and query items through your own
# ID scheme. External Ref is intended to be used on a 'per record' ID, where
# External source is to reference the source of all records, and can therefore
# differentiate multiple sources of data and potentially overlapping IDs
