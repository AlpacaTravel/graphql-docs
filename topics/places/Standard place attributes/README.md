# Standard Place Attributes

Alpaca maintain a series of standard place attributes that are used to collate
and standardise information access from various place providers. These place
attributes can also provide data structures that can be used to extend the
information further than what is provided by a standard place provider.

## Background to Attributes

- Attributes are a mechanism in the Alpaca GraphQL in order to offer
  extensibility of data relating to resources
- Attributes have a specific ID and data structure supported for the official
  attributes, but attributes can be used for your own extensible data
- Attributes can also have locale based values, enabling localisation for
  content
