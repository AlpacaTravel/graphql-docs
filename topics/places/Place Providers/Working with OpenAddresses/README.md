## Place ID

You can use a reference to a OpenAddresses place as a place within Alpaca.
Please note that limited information will be available, as addresses do not
correspond to place information (such as a venue that may be at that location).

<aside class="info">
  Place ID's may appear slightly different than other references online. 
  Alpaca replaces `/` with `.` for reference to the volumes that the UUID 
  for the address is located within.
