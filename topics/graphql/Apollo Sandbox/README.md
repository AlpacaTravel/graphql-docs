GraphQL offers an introspection capability with a defined schema. This helps you
develop the query that suits your specific use case or technical needs without
having to go through a lot of API Documentation.

Through the
[Apollo Sandbox](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/explorer?endpoint=https%3A%2F%2Fwithalpaca.com%2Fapi%2Fgraphql%3FaccessToken%3DUPDATE-TOKEN)
, you can try out your queries and mutations directly onto the GraphQL
environment.

- Lists out all the query and mutation operations and type fields that are
  available for the Alpaca Travel GraphQL API

- Supports autocompletion and validation of your operations

- Provides the ability to send operations and see the response
