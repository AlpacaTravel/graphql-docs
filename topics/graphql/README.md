## New to GraphQL?

GraphQL is a flexible data query language that allows you to design queries that
match your use case. Opposed to making several REST API requests or over/under
fetching data for your application, you craft a query to obtain the data you
need.

GraphQL is sent as JSON using a standard HTTP request. This makes it possible
for many different languages and frameworks capable of being able to execute
GraphQL calls to the Alpaca Travel GraphQL API.

If you are new to GraphQL, the following educational resources may be helpful as

GraphQL implementations can be simple as executing a query, and can then perform
better tools to handle caching and more advanced topics to support your app.
